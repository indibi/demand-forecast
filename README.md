# Introduction


# Data
The data used in this project is the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data which is available at https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

# Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps are outlined in the jupyter notebook `data_preprocessing.ipynb` which can be found in the `notebooks` folder. The data preprocessing steps include:
- Loading the data
- Checking for missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Filtering the data
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis

# Models
The models used in this project include:
- ARIMA
<!-- - SARIMA
- SARIMAX -->
- LSTM

# Model evaluation
The model evaluation steps are outlined in the jupyter notebook `model_evaluation.ipynb` which can be found in the `notebooks` folder. The model evaluation steps include:
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Model comparison

# Results
The results of the project are outlined in the jupyter notebook `results.ipynb` which can be found in the `notebooks` folder. The results include:
- Data preprocessing results
- Model evaluation results

<!-- # Conclusion -->
<!-- The results of the project show that the LSTM model outperforms the other models in terms of forecasting accuracy. The LSTM model is able to capture the complex patterns in the data and provide accurate forecasts. -->

<!-- # Future Work -->
<!-- In the future, we plan to further improve the LSTM model by tuning the hyperparameters and adding more features to the model. We also plan to explore other deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs for demand forecasting. -->
